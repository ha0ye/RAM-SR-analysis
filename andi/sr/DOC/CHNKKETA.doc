COMMENTS  @  2011625 sq meters rearing habibtat The Keta River is a clearwater river (not glacially influenced). The  chinook salmon stock is a "spring" stock.  Mature fish migrate through terminal marine waters in Southeast Alaska in May through early July.  These fish enter the lower  River in June and July. Chinook salmon are counted 2-4 times per season by foot and by.  The highest single-day count, summed across all index areas in the river, is used as the escapement index for that year
