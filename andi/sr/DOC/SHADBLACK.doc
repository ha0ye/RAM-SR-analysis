COMMENTS  @ natural mortality is assumed to vary with age, for ages 1 to 7 m = 0.35 0.35 0.35 0.35 0.70 2.70, this is the Danube population, I tried to calculate KGPRECF0 (my estimate was 0.23829) but this makes not sense. My guess is the spawning proportion is actually much less than assumed here (all spawners above age 3) because of high mortality due to fishing in the river. R. A. Myers
