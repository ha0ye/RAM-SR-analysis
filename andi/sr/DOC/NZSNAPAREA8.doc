COMMENTS  @ Recruitment was estimated from catch at age data fitted within a stock reduction analysis model; stock biomass = spawning stock biomass  was estimated within the same model which was also fitted to one tag-recapture  estimate and catch per unit effort data. Total landings are the recorded commercial catch plus a guessed recreational catch. Estimates of the recreational catch exist for only two recent years. Fishing mortality corresponds to the total landings.
