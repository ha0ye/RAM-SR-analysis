COMMENTS  @ 20920900 square meters rearing area. The Chickamin River is a glacial river. The  chinook salmon stock is a "spring" stock.  Mature fish migrate through terminal marine waters in Southeast Alaska in May through early July.  These fish enter the lower  River in June and July. Chinook salmon are counted 2-4 times per season by foot  and by helicopter.  The highest single-day count, summed across all index areas in the river, is used as the escapement index for that year
