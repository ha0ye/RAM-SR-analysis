COMMENTS  @ 1327672 sq. meters rearing habitat. The King Salmon River is a relatively small clearwater system on Admiralty Island in Southeast Alaska that drains an area of about 100 km2 . The King Salmon River chinook salmon stock is a "spring" stock.  Mature fish migrate through terminal marine waters in Southeast Alaska in May and June.  Maturing adults enter the river primarily in July. Chinook salmon were counted through a weir located near tidewater from 1983-1992 and counted all large chinook (3 to 5-ocean-age) and jacks (2-ocean age-no 1-ocean-age jacks have been observed for this stock, but may be present in some years).
