COMMENTS  @ Recruitment was estimated from trawl survey indices and scaled by a mean recruitment estimated in a stock reduction analysis model; stock biomass = spawning stock biomass was estimated in the same model which was fitted to two tag recapture estimates. Total landings are the recorded commercial catch plus a guessed proportion not reported plus a guessed recreational catch. Estimates of the recreational catch exist for only two recent years. Fishing mortality corresponds to total landings.
